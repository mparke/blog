Now that we've addressed the initial wave of feedback from the API alpha, we're
gearing up to add new features and bring it to parity with the existing system.
We are planning bi-weekly updates to the alpha, so expect a steady stream of
new features and tweaks.

Here's the first batch of changes, deployed today:

**Standards Compliance**<br/>
Through our open source initiatives, we received feedback that people would 
like a Standards compliant way to consume our API spec. We've decided to use
Swagger for this purpose because it has been adopted by the OpenAPI Specification.
Swagger has an excellent community around it with some
solid tools. While incomplete, the groundwork for our swagger implementation 
can be found [here](http://api.alpha.linode.com/v4/swagger.json).

**Root SSH Keys** <br/>
Now when deploying a new Linode or disk, you can
include a `root_ssh_key` parameter that will be placed in your filesystem, making
your first login painless.

**Token Expiration** <br/>
When does that token expire? [Login](https://login.alpha.linode.com) now displays
expiry information, making tokens easier to manage. Also, when a user logs out of
your application, you may now take the extra step of expiring that user's OAuth
token immediately, making your application more secure.

**Expanded Filtering Syntax** <br/>
Now you can include `+order_by`, `+limit`, and
`+order` operators in filters to write smarter queries.

**Unified Response Format** <br/>
We've removed the envelope from responses that return
a single object, making all requests consistent.

**Removed Partial Objects** <br/>
Some requests, like GETting a Linode, returned lists
of partial Distribution objects. We've done away with the concept of a partial
object and are now returning the entire object as documented everywhere.
 
In addition to these changes, v4.0.2a of the
[python client](https://github.com/linode/python-linode-api) has been released
with compatibility for all of the above features.

As always, we welcome any and all feedback on these features and others at our
[documentation github](https://github.com/linode/developers) or in the
#linode-next channel of [OFTC](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=linode-next&uio=d4).
Stay tuned for more features - API support for backups is on the horizon.
